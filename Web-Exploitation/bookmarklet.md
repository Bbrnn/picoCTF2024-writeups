# Bookmarklet

**Description**\
Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?\
Browse here, and find the flag!

**Hints**
1. A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.
2. What happens when you click a bookmarklet?
3. Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.

Bookmarklet is a tiny javascript that is executed as a bookmark in the browser\
