I click the link in the description and I find a web app. In this web app, I am supposed to upload  apng image.

I view the source code but I did not find anything interesting.

I check if there is a robots.txt file and fortunately there is a robots.txt file

I decide to check the file and directory that have been disallowed 

Instructions.txt

/Uploads directory

It makes that I cant access the uploads directory. From what I understood from the instructions.txt, I am supposed to upload a png file but I must modify the first magic bytes to hexadecimal of PNG.
