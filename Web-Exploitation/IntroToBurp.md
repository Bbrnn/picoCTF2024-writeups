# Intro to burp

**Description**

Try here to find the flag

**Hints**

1. Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
2. Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

## Solution
I navigated to the link provided from the description\
I found a registration page

I opened burpsuite and turned on intercept so as to capture the request as I registered\

This were my results after intercepting the register request

I forwarded the request and I got a 2FA authentication

I entered a dummy code and I intercepted it.

I wanted to see if I could bypass the 2fa authentication by deleting it in burpsuite\
After deleting the otp field and its value,I forwarded the request and found the flag\
